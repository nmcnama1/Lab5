Part 1: Getting started with BitBucket / Github
1. Sign up for Github or Bitbucket. Last year Github was easier to use from the lab
computers, but either should be fine this term.
2. Follow the tutorial on your choice, and ask TAs if you have questions. We will try
and provide some input prior to the lab period but feel as if the Linux-based
tutorials below are well done and definitely the place to start:
• Git: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
• Bitbucket: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository
3. Upload a brief description of this lab assignment and the Sudoku puzzle above to
a new, public project prior to check out. NOTE: We will check again during
grading to ensure you have set up a simple online repository, which will be
invaluable as you start your final projects.
4. If you have time, please continue to the Sudoku game portion of lab.
